    defination:- Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the process of hiding unnecessary 
    details and showing only the essential information about an object. It allows you to focus on the 
    essential features and behaviors of an object without getting overwhelmed by unnecessary details.

    example:- pow(x, y) gives x to the power y. but we don't need to know the implementation of pow(x, y)
